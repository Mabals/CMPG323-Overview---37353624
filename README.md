Development Branch - features and bug fixes will be developed in separated branches created from this branch.

#Use of .gitgnore file
Each project will include a .gitgnore file to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git.
Like: Temporary files and directories e.g. logs

Creadential and sensetive information should never be stored in the repository. I can use the environment variables or configuration management tool which ensure thaat files containing sensitive data are included in the .gutgnore file.
